# Food-Order-App

<p>The project is a modern food ordering app ReactMeals. The user can add things to the shopping cart, remove them, and make an order.</p>
<p>The application was built in JavaScript using React. The next part involved creating a server that sends relevant queries to the database. 
  Node.js was used for this. The menu is retrieved from the MySQL database. </p>
  <p>Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app it in your browser.<br>
The server runs on port 4000.  </p>
<p>For ease of use, a container was implemented  using Docker.</p>
